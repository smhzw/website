                Our Quest for Students' Mental Wellness

                The flames of our desire to make an impact in the mental wellness of Zimbabwean students got ignited the moment when the National University of Science and technology (NUST) in Bulawayo, the second largest city in Zimbabwe, experienced a series of suicide cases piling up one after the other in early 2019.

                The now-trustees – Lisa (former vice president of the NUST Students’ Representative Council), Takudzwa Innocent (former NUST Student Representative Council president) as well as Denis (the founding president of the peer educators’ club at NUST) - came together and brainstormed on how best this problem could be solved.

                Upon the realization that the problem is larger than it appeared on the surface, as it is not alien to other education institutions throughout the country, and that there isn’t much resources committed to address it in the conventional way, it became expedient upon the now-trustees to create an organization that will proffer innovative ways of alleviating the mental health challenges that are faced by the students in the nation; and one that will definitely outlive them.

                Through pulling out from the already-strained meagre student resources, they managed to get it up and running and already began installing systems that enables the effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions in solving the mentioned mental challenges among students. A bit slower as some may say it was in rolling it all out, we find great joy and happiness in the number of lives being impacted by the initiative, and the positive change brought about in the institutions.

                It is the sincere hope and wish of the trustees, as well as everyone who has ever served in the Executive, and all the wonderful volunteers; that the next generation of students may find our academic institutions safer from the mental ill-harm that us, the predecessors, have faced. We all have a part to play. You can too, either as a volunteer and/or chipping in a few dollars in donations for this great initiative to continue to grow, impacting even more lives.
